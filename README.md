# Portfolio 2022

Portfolio created with React, regrouping personal projects & projects from my OC formation.

## Dependencies

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Installs all the dependencies.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm deploys`

Creates and deploys the app as a github page.


## About the router

The [BrowserRouter] has been replaced by [HashRouter] as to allow the app to use the hash portion of the URL to run the app and its pages.
